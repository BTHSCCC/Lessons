# Lesson 1 (Intermediate)

> Takeaway:
>
> * Arrays are a simple and efficient data structure for storing collections of elements of the same type.
> * Dynamic arrays are a more flexible type of array that can grow and shrink in size as needed
> * Pairs and tuples are data structures that can store two or more elements of the same or different types.
> * Pairs are efficient for accessing and modifying the two elements that they store, while tuples are efficient for accessing and modifying the elements that they store and are immutable.

In order to begin learning competitive programming, we must discuss the building blocks of computer science: **data structures**

## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. They define the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on the data.

### Why are Data Structures Important?

Data structures are important because they allow us to write efficient algorithms. By choosing the right data structure for a problem, we can reduce the time and space complexity of our algorithms. This is important because it allows us to solve larger problems in less time and with less memory.

1. **Arrays**: An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays are simple and easy to use, but they have fixed size and can be inefficient when inserting or deleting elements.
2. Linked List:&#x20;
