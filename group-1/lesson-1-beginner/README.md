# Lesson 1 (Beginner)

Prior to competing in competitive programming, it is important that one understands the language that they're using.

&#x20;We begin this section by proposing the following question:

> What is a programming language?

A **programming language** is a special language that people use to talk to computers. Itâ€™s like a secret code that only computers can understand. Just like how people use different languages to communicate with each other, programmers use different programming languages to communicate with computers. However, there are a range of programming languages to choose from (that are officially supported by USACO's compiler):\

When choosing a language we should consider the following questions:\


* How fast will it take to run a program?
* How powerful is its Standard Library and support for Competitive Programming?

Questions like the above determine the pros and cons of other programming languages supported by USACO. The first question can be answered by this graph

The second question can be determined by this:

As you can see C++ is the BEST programming language for competitive programming and we want you guys to be the best so why not start with the best :smiling\_imp:
