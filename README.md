# Competitive Coding Club

We will be writing our lessons here, this will be mainly focused on beginners and we shall be teaching students both the theoretical and applied skills necessary to become a proficient competitive programmer for competitions such as USACO, AoC, Cornell High School Programming Contest, and University of Pennsylvania's PClassic.

The beginner section will be primarily taught using the C++ Programming language while in the intermediate class, we will be learning concepts with code segments in different languages. Throughout this course, students will be exposed to many concepts in Problem Solving, Data Structures and algorithms, Time Complexity, Math, etc.
